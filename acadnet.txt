RAM memory:
- Dynamic RAM: mid 90’s, main memory, gradually discharges energy so must be refreshed to mantain the stored data in the chip
- Static RAM: requires constant power, low power consumption, used as cache memory, much faster and expensive than DRAM
- Synchronous Dynamic RAM: DRAM that operates in synchronization with the memory bus, can process overlapping instructions in parallel (read before write completed), higher transfer rates
- Double Data Rate SDRAM: twice as fast as SDRAM, supports two writes and two reads per CPU clock cycle, 184 pin connector with a single notch, lower voltage 2.5 V, 200 Mhz, family DDR - DDR4
- DDR2 SDRAM: twice as fast as SDRAM, higher clock speed than DDR 533 Mhz, improves performance by decreasing noise and crosstalk between signal wires, 240 pin connector, lower voltage 1.8 V
- DDR3 SDRAM: double the clock rate of DDR2 and expanded bandwidth, higher clock speed than DDR2 800 Mhz, generates less heat, 240 pin connector, less power 1.5 V
- DDR4 SDRAM: quadruples maximum DDR3 storage capacity, higher clock speed than DDR3 1600 Mhz, 288 pin connector, less power 1.2 V, compatible with Error Correting Code Memory (ECC) to detect multiple bits erros
- GDDR SDRAM: video graphic card memory, used in conjunction with a dedicated GPU, family GDDR - GDDR5, each member improving performance and power consumption, processes massive amounts of data but not necessarily at the fastest speeds

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):
- Functions:
Striping - data distributed across multiple drives, increased performance, failure of a single drive loses all data
Mirroring - duplicate data on one or more other drives, redundancy in case of a single drive failure, enables reconstruction of data
	Parity - basic error checking and fault tolerance by storing checksums separately from data, enables reconstruction of data
	Double Parity - fault tolerance up to two failed drives
- Levels:
	0 (zero): minimum number of drives 2, Striping, Performance and Capacity - all data lost if one drive fails
	1 (one): minimum number of drives 2, Mirroring, Performance and Reliability - capacity is half the total drive size
	5 (five): minimum number of drives 3, Striping and Parity, Performance, Reliability and Capacity - it takes time to rebuild array if a drive fails
	6 (six): minimum number of drives 3, Striping and Double Parity, Performance, Reliability (2 failures) and Capacity - it takes time to rebuild array if drives fail
	10, 0 + 1 (ten): minimum number of drives 4, Mirroring and Striping, Performance, Capacity and High Reliability - capacity is half the total drive size

ACPI power states:
- S0: computer is on and CPU is running
- S1: CPU and RAM are still receving power, unused devices are powered down
